# Setup and Access

## BigQuery Setup

BigQuery can be accessed in three ways: through the [BigQuery console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), the BigQuery command line interface, and through BigQuery APIs in Python or R. For more information on using BigQuery in R, refer to Section 4.1. 

BigQuery is part of the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Details of getting your machine set up with GCP products is covered in the emLab SOP [Section 5.1](https://emlab-ucsb.github.io/SOP/5-1-google-cloud-platform.html). Once gcloud is installed and your credentials are authenticated you should be able to set `emlab-gcp` as your project which will link you to emLabâ€™s billing account. If you have any problems joining or connecting to `emlab-gcp`, please get in touch and we will help set you up. 

The BigQuery console provides a nice interface for writing and validating queries. The upper left corner of the BigQuery console displays the billing project code. For most emLab users, this should say `emlab-gcp`. The upper right corner shows the user, make sure you are logged in when running queries. Queries can be written in the query editor window and the validator will tell you how large the query is and will warn you if there are any syntax errors in the query. Once a query is run, the results will be displayed beneath the query editor window. Projects, datasets, and tables are displayed on the left hand side of the console.

## Billing

Queries cost *$5/ TB*. Best practice is always to use the validator in BigQuery to check the size of the query before running it. Any query over 100 GB should generally be considered large and caution should be taken when running them. Please see Section 4, Workflow, for more suggestions on best practices for streamlining workflow between BigQuery and R.
